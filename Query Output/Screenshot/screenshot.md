🔹 [Company Performance Deviation](Cte_Analysis/company_performance_deviation.png)

    This output shows how each employee’s rating deviates from the company average (2), highlighting above-average performers (positive deviation) 
    and at-risk or average employees (zero deviation) for targeted performance management.

🔹 [Hiring Efficiency Index by Company](Cte_Analysis/hiring_efficiency_index_by_company.png)

🔹 [Skill_Density_Impact](Kpi_Metrics/skill_density_impact.png)

    Skill Count vs Performance Insight

    Performance improves when employees have up to 3 skills, but adding more skills does not guarantee higher ratings, indicating diminishing returns     beyond an optimal skill count.
  
🔹 [Skill_Roi](Kpi_Metrics/skill_roi_score.png)

    Most skills deliver similar performance return per salary unit, with AWS, React, and data engineering skills marginally leading, indicating           balanced ROI across the skill stack.

# Window Function

🔹 [City Level Talent Ranking](Windows_Function/city_level_talent_ranking.png)

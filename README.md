# 🇮🇳 Hiring Efficiency & Skill-ROI Intelligence System (SQL)
  A business-driven SQL analytics project that evaluates how efficiently companies in India convert salary spend and skills into employee performance.


## Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world HR analytics system, answering high-impact business questions around hiring efficiency, skill ROI, compensation effectiveness, attrition risk, and talent distribution across companies and cities.

---
## Why This Project Stands Out

✔ Goes beyond basic SQL queries
✔ Focuses on decision-making KPIs, not just data extraction
✔ Uses CTEs, Window Functions, and advanced aggregations
✔ Designed like a real analytics system, not an assignment
✔ Clean documentation tailored for recruiters and interviewers

## Business Problems Solved

This system answers questions that HR leaders, founders, and hiring managers actually care about:

Which skills generate the highest performance per salary unit?

Are companies overpaying or hiring efficiently?

Does higher salary guarantee better performance?

Which employees show early attrition risk?

How does city-level talent ROI differ across India?

Is skill quantity or skill relevance more important?

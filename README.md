# 🇮🇳 Hiring Efficiency & Skill-ROI Intelligence System (SQL)
A business-driven SQL analytics project that evaluates how efficiently companies in India convert salary spend and skills into employee              performance.


## Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world HR analytics system, answering high-impact business questions around hiring efficiency, skill ROI,               compensation effectiveness, attrition risk, and talent distribution across companies and cities.

---
## Why This Project Stands Out

    ✔ Goes beyond basic SQL queries

    ✔ Focuses on decision-making KPIs, not just data extraction

    ✔ Uses CTEs, Window Functions, and advanced aggregations

    ✔ Designed like a real analytics system, not an assignment

    ✔ Clean documentation tailored for recruiters and interviewers

## Business Problems Solved

    This system answers questions that HR leaders, founders, and hiring managers actually care about:
  
    * Which skills generate the highest performance per salary unit?

    * Are companies overpaying or hiring efficiently?

    * Does higher salary guarantee better performance?

    * Which employees show early attrition risk?

    * How does city-level talent ROI differ across India?

    * Is skill quantity or skill relevance more important?

## Key Analytical Themes

    Hiring Efficiency Index – performance delivered per salary unit

    Skill ROI Score – value created by each skill per ₹1L salary

    Attrition Risk Scoring – performance-based risk indicators

    Performance Deviation Analysis – employee vs company benchmarks

    Skill Density Impact – diminishing returns of multi-skilling

    City-Level Talent ROI – location-wise hiring effectiveness
